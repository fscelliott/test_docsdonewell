I got a permanently dedicated section of our department's newsletter. *someone 
took the time to make me a logo!* I feel so loved.

The actual script they chose to feature in their newsletter this month is 
ever-so-humble, and was really quick and easy for me to author...but 
apparently it had an impact, because I'm already seeing reviewers adopt it. 
Nice when it works out that way!
