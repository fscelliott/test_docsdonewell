I've taken on some new roles in my team recently: 

## Agile coach 

I'll be the agile coach for a 3-month stint for my team.  We face BIG 
challenges in implementing agile, the biggest being: 

-lack of tooling:  since we work in highly regulated industry, our tools are 
waterfall-focused, and jumping over to agile-focused tools is a huge approval 
process. We hope (*HOPE!*) to have better tools -- ie GitHub, Jira support for 
Agile -- in place by late 2017. 

-team complexity -- Coordination across executives, researchers, offering 
management, sw dev teams, ux, etc, across multiple offerings across TWO 
companies (parent company/acquired company) that both have required, differing 
regulatory processes? Very very tough. Biggest challenge I see is at the 
moment, some upcoming projects lack epics/hills. My hope is that for the 
projects that DO have epics/hills, we can build out our stories/tasks so as to 
provide workable examples/templates for other projects. 

In the meantime the program manager and I have cobbled together an awkward 
issue tracking process involving issue types, links, titles, and labels.  It's 
incredibly manual at this point. We'll hobble along until later in the year, 
when better Agile support will be available, and I'll be checking regularly 
with my scrum masters to see if we can make any improvements given the 
limitations. 

## Software Release Manager 
At my company, there's a traditional documentation set that technical writers 
are responsible for,  and another set that developers are traditionally 
responsible for. But I have enough technical depth that I can contribute to 
the developer docs too (stuff like functional specs, SW design specs, etc), 
and so I am.  I've also taken over project managing these docs from my SW 
development boss. 

This also means I'm working on defining documentation processes, since our 
docs are all highly interrelated and highly regulated. For example, helping to 
come up with a process for tracking and maintaining our third-party components 
in a 400-row-plus spreadsheet (that one was a bear!); defining and writing up 
in our wiki how to document unit tests and code reviews, etc, etc.
