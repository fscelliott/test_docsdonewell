I'm really excited to follow Tom Johnson's upcoming series on structured 
authoring in DITA vs. Jekyll at 
[http://idratherbewriting.com/2015/03/23/new-series-jekyll-versus-dita/](http://idratherbewriting.com/2015/03/23/new-series-jekyll-versus-dita/). 

When Tom first started writing about reusing static content with Jekyll ( 
[http://idratherbewriting.com/2015/02/27/static-site-generators-start-to-displace-online-cmss/](http://idratherbewriting.com/2015/02/27/static-site-generators-start-to-displace-online-cmss/)) 
he kind of blew my mind. I'd gotten the impression that for writers at small 
companies/startups, there weren't any really good content reuse technologies 
out there. But the templates Tom authored looks *super slick!* 

In fact those templates stand in stark contrast to my own experiences 
tinkering with the DITA-OT. A couple years ago, I spent a week, purely for my 
own edification, following this tutorial: [DITA for solo 
writers](https://belug.de/~lutz/pub/vortrag/20080213/ditaguide.pdf). 

It was a heroic effort on the author's part, I must say! And after a bunch of 
effort, I did in fact manage to hack the DITA-OT with a small topic 
specialization and content reuse. 

And what was my output? Minimally formatted PDFs (I felt lucky I got an output 
at all; fixing broken PDFs was a big issue), and  seriously old-school HTML 
output: 

![dita html](/assets/images/slow_cooker_dita.png) 

and the PDF output:

![dita html](/assets/images/slow_cooker_dita_pdf.png) 

(I wrote a 
recipes DITA specialization, because at the time I was really into perfecting 
my slow cooker skills).

Contrast that with 
the much-easier tutorial Tom posted, and the slick output:

...OK, I know 
the compare is somewhat apples and oranges. But still--If I ever get a spare 
moment, I might just try out that tutorial!
