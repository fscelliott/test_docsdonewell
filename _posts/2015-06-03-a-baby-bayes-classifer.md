Actually, the blog title is a misnomer--I started trying to code up a naive 
Bayes classifer while studying[ chapter 6](http://www.nltk.org/book/ch06.html) of the Python NLTK book, but I didn't get very far before I switched over to a tutorial on the scikit-learn [random forest 
classifer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial/details/part-1-for-beginners-bag-of-words), because it aimed at building something instead of demonstrating little 
building blocks. 

I haven't gotten far, but at this point I can create a feature set from a cleaned-up 'bag of words' using scikit-learn.

Next up: training the random forest! (I love the terminology involved, by the 
way. "training the random forest" sounds like a nonsense poem).
