I recently got re-interested* in natural language processing, in conjunction 
with working on a taxonomy/ontology and reading about applications for 
taxonomies and ontologies. 

I found a course with all materials on GitHub that looked pretty interesting: 
[Applied Natural Language 
Processing](https://github.com/utcompling/applied-nlp), and thought I'd give 
the exercises a go in my free time. 

But. But. From day one, the coursework emphasizes functional programming. And 
it's like starting from square one! 

Even capturing parameters from the command line stumped me. I felt like a 
total dope, until I went home and talked to my spouse, who, keep in mind, is 
getting a PhD in computational and applied math. 
 "Ohhh...yeah, functional programming is really academically interesting but 
hard," he says. Then he starts talking about lambda calculus and provable 
code, and I get a bit lost. 
"Wait...so what's the advantage of functional programming for natural language 
processing?" I ask. 
"Good question; I don't know." 
So, the next day I spend time trying to answer that question, and I suppose I 
have a little bit of an answer--it's good for cleanly defining mappings and 
therefore good for tree manipulation(?) 

However, it felt like a bit much to learn functional programming *and* a 
little bit of linguistics *and* programming tasks in the NLP domain in my free 
time.  So after a bit more sleuthing, I stumbled across Python's Natural 
Language Toolkit (NLTK), and was bowled over by the resources--there's an 
[entire book](http://www.nltk.org/book/) online! 

So I've temporarily abandoned Scala and I'm currently in the second chapter of 
the Python NLTK book.  It hasn't gotten hard yet and is still a ton of fun. 

\*Actually, I've been interested in NLP for a while, but when I checked out 
Coursera's  [NLP class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/language-processing) a couple years 
ago, I got discouraged--it seemed very mathy! Coming back to it now, I feel 
more confident in my technical skills in general, and I've started to 
incompletely connect the dots between NLP and less-mathy linguistics--[this 
post](http://thelousylinguist.blogspot.com/2010/01/why-linguists-should-study-math.html) 
in particular encouraged me by arguing that the math that computational 
linguists need to know is 'not that hard'.
