During the last year, I became a software project manager. Wow. Not something 
I was expecting. 
It's a chaotic (to say the least) environment I've been thrown into -- 
especially in the realm of decision making (in fact, I think I probably need 
to sit down and think exactly what environment I'm in a la the [Cyefin 
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework)framework). 
The first few months felt like a breathless attempt to keep up, but finally, 
this Friday, I had a chance to sit down and take baby steps toward acquiring a 
knowledge framework for my job. Of course, my company has some online training 
modules, but I wanted an individual voice of experience (and my mentor is out 
on leave out the moment). Of course, googling 'best practices agile software 
project management' is going to get me a lot of hits -- but many of those are 
from paid consultants, and many are highly general. I wanted something more 
grounded and personal than that. 

Luckily, I happened to remember that a blogger whose personal writings I've 
been following for years, is also a (biotech) project manager &amp; 
consultant! I spent about 2 hours devouring her content over at  [Beyond 
Managing](http://beyondmanaging.com/)  and at [Chronicle 
Vitae](https://chroniclevitae.com/people/268359-melanie-nelson/articles) . 

I love her pragmatism and honesty -- particularly her admission that she was 
an accidental manager -- thrown into the role because she was excellent as an 
individual contributor -- and that she didn't at first view project management 
as 'real work' compared to technical work. I identify on both counts!  Or 
rather, I understood even before I became one that project management was real 
work -- because I've seen both excellent and poor examples in the workplace 
--- but I didn't know if it could give me the satisfied feeling of 'getting 
stuff done' that say, publishing an API reference from scratch could.  Now I 
am starting to understand from my own experience (and from reading hers) that 
yes, the *process *of figuring out how to get work done well as a PM can 
present mental challenges and satisfactions on par with 'concrete' technical 
work. No, the output is not so tangible -- but that's OK with me. I get my 
reward from the process, not from work artifacts. So what parts do I like the 
best? So far, I most enjoy: 

1. digging deep to truly understand the implications of 
the technical work in terms of schedule, risks, and dependencies 
1. translating detailed technical explanations from development managers into 
summaries for executives 
1. noticing when critical conversations are lagging and driving them to 
conclusion 
1. reconciling ambiguity underlying functional specifications and turning 
research language into software engineering language 
1. being the person who has the answers to engineers' questions about priorities, cross-functional teams; and articulating agile best practices. 



So, I can definitely see how project management could give me years of 
interesting challenges, but a lingering question for me at this point is -- 
have I gotten the technical depth I wanted as an individual contributor yet?  
How to balance the 'fun' of deep-diving into a new technical area with the 
more general approach necessary for a manager? Or is it a false dichotomy I'm 
constructing here? (I've heard a dev exec mention that he thinks the best 
project managers are those who are most technical, after all).
