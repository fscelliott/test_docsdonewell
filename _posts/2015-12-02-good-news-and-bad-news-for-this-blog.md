The good news is, I got a new job that I really like! I'm now working as an 
information developer for IBM Watson; the technology is really interesting. 

The bad news for this blog is, we're encouraged to blog internally, which 
affects our performance reviews. So, now I'm blogging about my job *at* my 
job, and I doubt I'll keep up two separate blogs. That said, I might find time 
here and again to adapt one of my internal posts to a public audience -- we'll 
see!
