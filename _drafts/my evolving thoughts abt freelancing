seminal convo w/ mike herrick
read tons of jonathan stark + looked @ web presence of his former clients
got discouraged after a while that no one would pay for docs consulting
listened to freelance transformation, ditching hourly, the freelance hour (devchattv) , consulting pipeline (philip morgan)
      they ALL have the same story: I billed hourly and was miserable, I expanded, I started an agency, I got burnt out/went broke, I started consulting w/ value based fees and voila!
got more overwhelmed and discouraged -- espeically after reading: ((see his whole freelancing category: https://www.jasonswett.net/the-freelancer-consultant-spectrum/ and 
listend to 'break the cycle of indefinite engagement' episode was key on freelance hour:
    -some people DO happily contract for years
    -argument that you're not building IP is not so urgent in my case --- if working for startups, you're playing a bigger role than you would in a large corp so you're definitely building up expertise
    
    
    -'you need to have shorter, 1-2 week engagements so you can have multiple clients a month. 'one of the reason eveyron understands that consultants charge big fees is that they have to spend a lot of time marketing/not charging $
    
    -a line from 'freelance transform' also did it: 'how to charge premium fees? find clients who have a lot to gain from your services'

-talked to Mary Thengeval, who led me to Cristiano Betta, who let me see there ARE people who do DX consulting. 

- 8/20 -- enjoying being 'merely' a contractor, but in a devrel team. enjoying implementing strategy that comes in frm the team. worried that if contracting trends to be very short-term type stuff (3-6m) I'll burn out.
