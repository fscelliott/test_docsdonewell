something about how, in the midst of everythin,g you've got to maintain priority for the GSG -- certain links, certain value-prop text (syced w/ marketing), etc.
need to have that stuff documented among the tech writers somewhere, too. 
ok if the hot spots are manual/break other tooling for the time being?
where would you document this knowledge? (invitation for discussion)
