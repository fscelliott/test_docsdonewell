Recently, I've been rethinking developer onboarding for my client because of a domain-model/UX overhaul of the API & corresponding online app.
I've been researching developer onboarding experiences, and I stumbled across two that were fun to compare and contrast.
I made a little video:

Highlights:

0:00 - Why this video? I'm researching developer onboarding experiences.
1:18 - Walkthrough of Docker desktop CLI guide. nice features: recoverable experience, no signup required,  but mainly: GUI interface wrapper for terminal tutorial(!) 
9:01 - An aside on account sign-up friction and why a SaaS company might or might not optimize it
11:00 - Maildrop and other disposable email tools for recreating onboarding experiences
11:22 - Walkthrough of contentful's CLI guide. nice features: launch browser to display my API token, numbered steps, y/n prompts to create the project, step explanations
