Eloquent javascript

I know everyone references it and likes it but...funny scenarios aside (which I like), I find it very dense. The examples are often way too long, and in the absence of interactivity (since it's just a book), I glaze over. I think it's probably a good resource when you're already familiar with the concepts and want to go deeper, but not good for a beginner....or it could be made great with less density and with an online format that allows for trying out the code yourself with codepen or similar.
