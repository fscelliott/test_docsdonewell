Review processes
If you’ve ever tried to review docs using tools like GitHub, which has the best interface by far for code reviews, it’s cumbersome. I’ve participated in a number of doc reviews with GitHub for Jekyll’s docs, and I find GitHub awkward and inefficient. Tools like Google Docs or even Microsoft Word work much better at facilitating conversations around specific points in your docs.

If you try to use more code-intensive review tools like Review Board, the views will show only what has changed in the latest commits. But with documentation, reviewers usually need to see the whole document in its published form to view it effectively. You can’t just look at lines that changed here and there.

Further, code review tools show the code view, which is harder to process than the browser-rendered view. GitHub lets you comment inline in the code, but looking at the code, you won’t know what it looks like when rendered by the browser. That browser rendering is important to see images, styling, and other formatting. I’m not saying an engineer couldn’t toggle between the rendered output and the code view, then make comments in the code view. But it’s awkward because you have to keep shifting between two views and re-finding your place on the page.

Further, most engineers (ironically) won’t review your docs using code review tools. Most engineers I’ve worked with prefer to provide comments in email threads, Google docs (if allowed), or Word files.
